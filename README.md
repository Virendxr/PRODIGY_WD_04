# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

A clean, responsive, and animated portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This site showcases my web development projects, skills, certifications, and activities as a BCA student at Amrita University.

## 📝 Overview

This portfolio features a modern UI with animated sections, a preloader, dark mode support, and smooth scrolling. It highlights three web apps built using vanilla JavaScript:

- A **Digital Stopwatch** with lap functionality and sound effects  
- A **Tic Tac Toe** game with win/draw detection  
- A **Weather App** using real-time data from OpenWeatherMap API

The site also includes a resume-style About section, skill grid, certificates, and responsive design for all screen sizes.
